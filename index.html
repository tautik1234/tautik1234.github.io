                    <p>Myself <strong style="color:rgb(58, 113, 230)">Tautik</strong>. I'm currently pursuing a 
                        Bachelor's degree in <strong>Computer Science (Data Science)</strong> at 
                        <strong>Prasad V. Potluri Siddhartha Institute of 
                        Technology</strong>, where I'm developing a solid 
                        foundation in software development, data 
                        structures, and algorithms. Born in 
                        Vijayawada, my schooling was done in 
                        Visakhapatnam. Later in my intermediate, 
                        our family shifted to Vijayawada. I 
                        enjoy solving problems, experimenting 
                        with code, and continuously improving my 
                        skills through hands-on projects. 
                        I'm proficient in <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Java</strong>, <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">HTML</strong>, and <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">CSS</strong>, 
                        and I'm currently strengthening my grip 
                        on <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Python</strong> and <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">JavaScript</strong> to expand my 
                        capabilities in full-stack development. 
                        I'm interested in web 
                        development and data analytics, and 
                        I'm exploring areas like responsive 
                        design, user interfaces, and interactive 
                        websites. Outside coding, I watch movies, call myself a cinephile, 
                        watching various genre 
                        movies. I also am
                        good at video editing, the software I use 
                        is CapCut, or Premiere Pro. I also enjoy
                        playing table tennis. I aspire to become a 
                        well-rounded software engineer, contribute 
                        to impactful projects, and eventually build 
                        solutions that create value for people and 
                        businesses alike.

                        <p>Besides all of the academical works, I do 
                            enjoy creating content. I myself am an
                            amateur video editor, the softwares I use/d
                            consists of the OG Kinemaster, CapCut, Priemere
                            Pro, and a few more. I also write stories,
                            however I didn't even publish one. I am aiming
                            to complete a story and publish it soon. I also
                            had mixed a few audios, I learnt audio mixing as
                            a part of my video editing hobby. It helped me a lot
                            to understand about many basic things about audio
                            like reverb, sync-beat and sync-mixing, audio delay
                            etc. I am also learning Game Development out of interest,
                            in whose hunt I found out GoDot - the open-source game
                            engine which is light yet powerful. I created a sample
                            game and deployed it in my alternate account, Veltrix.
                            The game was totally made out of walkthrough and hence
                            it wouldn't be much engaging, however it did made me
                            learn about all of the basic things needed to create a
                            game. I would love to develop an indie 2D game in the
                            near future. I am eager to learn new technologies and
                            create a product out of them.
